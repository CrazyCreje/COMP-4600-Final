# COMP-4600-Final

    DISCLAIMER: This project was completed with the assistance of the following tutorial

found [here](https://k-d-w.org/blog/2019/07/survival-analysis-for-deep-learning/).

## Prerequisites

You must have the following dependencies on your system to execute tutorial.ipynb:

- [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-survival](https://github.com/sebp/scikit-survival/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (version must be <= 1.15)

I recommend you create a Python virtual environment for all these packages because
tensorflow can mess with your system's Python dependencies when not using one.

## Running

Open up tutorial.ipynb in VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, or some software that supports python
notebooks. One the file is opened, run all cells to execute the code. Additionally, if your
tensorboard does not populate with a dataset, try to train the model first in the following
cell, then run the tensorboard.

## Evidence of Completion

The directory screenshots/ contains evidence of running tutorial.ipynb on my machine. The
terminal depicted shows a run of nvidia-smi during the training of the CNN.
